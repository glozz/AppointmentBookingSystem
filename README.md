## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for:

- User service (profile, sessions, admin operations)

Run tests:
```bash
dotnet test --verbosity normal
```

## Database

The database is automatically created and seeded with:
- Admin user account
- 4 branches with operating hours
- 9 banking services
- 4 appointment types
- 6 consultants per branch with unique South African names

### Database Tables
- `Users` - User accounts with authentication data
- `Sessions` - Active user sessions
- `ActivityLogs` - Audit trail
- `Notifications` - User notifications
- `AppointmentTypes` - Types of appointments
- `Appointments` - Booked appointments
- `Customers` - Customer information
- `Branches` - Branch locations
- `Services` - Available services
- `Consultants` - Branch consultants who handle appointments

## Booking Rules

The appointment booking system enforces the following rules:

### Operating Hours
- Default operating hours: **08:00 - 17:00**
- Branch-specific operating hours are respected when configured
- Bookings cannot be made outside operating hours or on closed days

### Time Slots
- All appointments must be scheduled on **15-minute increments** (e.g., 09:00, 09:15, 09:30, 09:45)
- Appointment duration is determined by the selected service

### Multi-Consultant Booking
- Multiple customers can book the same time slot at a branch (up to the number of available consultants)
- A unique index on `(ConsultantId, AppointmentDate, StartTime)` prevents a single consultant from being double-booked
- Server-side validation checks consultant availability before accepting a booking

### Consultant Auto-Assignment
- When creating an appointment, a consultant is automatically assigned from the selected branch
- A consultant is considered available if they have no overlapping appointments in the requested time window
- Overlap detection uses robust logic: `existing.Start < requestedEnd && requestedStart < existing.End`
- If no consultants are available, the booking is rejected with an appropriate error message

### Real-Time Availability Wizard
The booking wizard provides real-time feedback on appointment availability:
- **Step-by-step wizard** guides users through selecting branch, date, and time
- **Color-coded availability indicators** show slot status:
  - 🟢 **Green** - High availability (more than 50% of consultants available)
  - 🟡 **Yellow** - Limited availability (50% or fewer consultants available)
  - 🟠 **Orange/Red** - Last slot! (only 1 consultant available)
- **Mobile-responsive design** adapts to all screen sizes
- Slots are only shown if at least one consultant is available

### Customer Details
- Customer information (First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone) is pre-populated from the logged-in user's account
- Customer fields are rendered as readonly on the booking form
- Server-side validation re-resolves customer information from the authenticated user to prevent tampering

## Consultant Seeding

At application startup, the system automatically seeds 6 consultants per branch:
- Each consultant has a unique South African first name: **Thabo, Sipho, Nomsa, Lerato, Kabelo, Ayanda**
- The surname matches the branch name (e.g., "Thabo Sandton" for Sandton City Branch)
- The seeder is idempotent: it only adds consultants if fewer than 6 exist for a branch
- Consultants are stored in the `Consultants` table with a foreign key to their branch

## Authentication Integration

The MVC web application integrates with the API's authentication system using cookies to bridge server-rendered pages with the API-first authentication.

### Architecture Overview

1. **AccountController**: Handles login, register, and logout actions by posting to the API endpoints (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/logout`).
2. **AccessTokenHandler**: A `DelegatingHandler` that automatically attaches access tokens to outgoing API requests and handles token refresh on 401 responses.
3. **Cookie Authentication**: The web app uses ASP.NET Core cookie authentication to maintain user sessions.

### Cookie Settings

The application uses secure, HttpOnly cookies with the following configuration:

| Cookie | Purpose | Settings |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `access_token` | JWT access token for API calls | HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict |
| `refresh_token` | Token for refreshing access tokens | HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict |
| `AppointmentBooking.Auth` | ASP.NET Core authentication cookie | HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict |

### Token Refresh Contract

The `AccessTokenHandler` automatically handles token refresh:

1. Attaches `access_token` cookie value as Bearer token to outgoing requests
2. On 401 Unauthorized response, attempts refresh via `POST /api/auth/refresh`
3. Updates cookies with new tokens on successful refresh
4. Retries the original request with the new access token

**Expected API Response Format for `/api/auth/refresh`:**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJ...",
  "refreshToken": "abc123...",
  "accessTokenExpiryMinutes": 60,
  "refreshTokenExpiryDays": 7
}
```

### Secure Cookie Requirements

For production deployments:

- **HTTPS Required**: Cookies are configured with `Secure` flag, requiring HTTPS
- **SameSite=Strict**: Prevents CSRF attacks by not sending cookies on cross-site requests
- **HttpOnly**: Prevents JavaScript access to tokens, mitigating XSS attacks

### Environment Variables

Configure the following for production:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ApiSettings__BaseUrl` | Base URL of the authentication API | `https://api.example.com` |
| `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` | Database connection string | (see appsettings) |

### Development Setup

1. Ensure the API is running on the configured `ApiSettings:BaseUrl` (default: `http://localhost:5000`)
2. Update `appsettings.json` or set environment variables
3. Run the web application

### Security Recommendations

1. **Always use HTTPS** in production
2. **Set strong JWT keys** via environment variables
3. **Configure proper CORS** policies on the API
4. **Enable HSTS** (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
5. **Rotate refresh tokens** on each use
6. **Set appropriate token expiry** times based on security requirements
